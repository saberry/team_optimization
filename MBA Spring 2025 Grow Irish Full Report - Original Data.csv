MBA Consulting Projects



MBA Consulting Projects require significant preparation, both individually and collaboratively with your project team and sponsor, prior to the start of Grow Irish Week. The projects entail a full-time, off-campus commitment from Monday, March 3, at 8:00 AM, through Friday, March 7, at noon, with work hours running at a minimum from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. European project teams leave on Saturday, March 1. North American project teams leave on Sunday, March 2. No absences are permitted for students on consulting project teams.  



When considering a Consulting Project, please keep in mind that:

	Being selected for an MBA Consulting Project is a privilege. To be eligible for an MBA Consulting Project, students must be in good standing, meaning they are not on academic probation, do not have a financial hold on their student account, and do not have a history of disciplinary concerns that would adversely affect participation on a client-serving team (including past performance on a Grow Irish project);
	Consulting projects include ~ 5 hours of pre-departure meetings and ~10 hours of prep time;
	Your assigned project team may consist of MBA students you do not know well who bring a variety of backgrounds and personalities;
	You will be asked to perform in a somewhat ambiguous environment with a short turnaround time;
	You may travel to a new and unfamiliar city;
	Domestic and international travel can sometimes include challenges. While disruptive, schedule changes are part of travel and we can all work together to adapt to the changes, adjust expectations, and maintain a positive attitude;
	No absences are permitted for students on consulting project teams, including interviews;
	Students who did not participate in an international Grow Irish project in the Fall will be given first preference for an international project in the Spring;
	If you are uncertain about your schedule during the week of Spring Grow Irish (potential interviews, possible travel conflicts, etc.), select a Skill Building session. 

Teams for consulting projects will be built using an optimization algorithm. The algorithm will consider student preferences, project team capacity, pathway/skillset relative to skills needed for the project, and gender in order to build diverse and high-functioning teams to successfully accomplish project deliverables. Regarding gender, the algorithm will seek to minimize the number of teams with only 1 male or 1 female and to maximize the number of teams with at least 2 men or 2 women. This will not be possible in all cases.



***********************
MBA Skill Building



Skill Building sessions take place on campus Monday through Thursday, March 3-6th, from 9am-2:30pm with a 30 minute break for lunch. Students with any conflicts during Grow Irish must choose a Skill Building section and make up all missed work as directed by the instructor.



When considering Skill Building, please keep in mind that:

	No absences are permitted unless pre-approved by the Office of Experiential and Global Learning;
	Interviews and networking activities should be scheduled before/after class or during break;
	Absences of more than one day will require make-up work, coordinated with the Office of Experiential and Global Learning and the session facilitator.




Skill Building sessions will be assigned using an optimization algorithm. The algorithm will consider student preferences, number of seats available in each section, and pathway. Students will be assigned a Skill Building session who: Indicate a preference for a Skill Building; Do not complete the preference survey by the deadline; Are not eligible for an MBA Consulting Project; or Have a conflict during any part of Spring Grow Irish.

 

Special cases


	Some Dual degree students are not required to participate in Grow Irish. See your advisor for more details.
	The Spring Business on the Frontlines course fulfills the Spring Grow Irish requirement. (Participation in a Fall BOTFL course has no bearing on Spring Grow Irish placement).
	REEL (Regenerating Ecologies, Economies, and Livelihoods) takes place during Spring break and does not conflict with Spring Grow Irish. Students enrolled in REEL are required to take a Spring Grow Irish course.","Discerning the Right Spring Grow Irish Fit

To prepare, I’m focused on building technical skills to better understand their work and relate to their challenges. Over the past semester, I became proficient in web development with JavaScript and non-relational databases like Firebase. The Grow Irish SQL course could deepen my knowledge by providing a reason to build and practice the other side of the db-architecure coin–relational databases–a concept I’ve found fascinating through reading about SQL form normalization and learning how to write basic SQL injections.   Additionally, I’m interested in learning to learn Tableau or Python, as I consider those fundamental pillars of business analytics and machine learning for the same reasons. I’d prefer to learn Tableau as I have slight experience with Python already, and building business dashboards just seems fun.

Not only did this course allow me to develop principles for how to navigate social impact and community-focused work, but it also provided me with the opportunity to learn through active service. This hands-on approach allowed me to integrate theoretical knowledge with practical skills, particularly in the realm of strategic communication and enterprise development. During Grow Irish, I want to build off of my knowledge base developed in Frontlines to assist COPE Galway with addressing their strategic messaging issues by creating an actionable strategy that based off of recent projects I have worked on.

I am a two-year MBA student concentrating in strategy and minoring in innovation/entrepreneurship and social impact. My passion for creating a generational shift in the mindset of the consumer from over-consumption for few to adequate consumption for all has led me to working on projects from Uganda to West Virginia, USA. More specifically I have worked on strategic development and social impact projects centered around community development (specifically at-risk communities i.e. homeless and individuals experiencing substance abuse) and strategic outreach.

They all expressed that comfort comes only after finishing several ""reps,” and that simply being on consulting projects is the only way to get those reps in. I found that my experience with Grow Irish this fall was exactly the kind of rep I need, incredibly valuable and directly translatable to the work I will do after graduation. I was asked to develop key performance indicators for a tech startup, which required forcing myself to power through the discomfort of feeling clueless to generate valuable insights for the client’s request. 
Looking at my own preparedness for consulting post-graduation and thinking about the guidance from EY-P leaders, another consulting project would be helpful to furthering my own comfort as a consultant. Specifically, my goals for this project are to become more comfortable speaking to clients about topics I don't fully understand, to become faster at building an effective slide deck, and to continue positioning myself as a strong consultant for government/public sector work (the vertical I am working toward at EY-P).

In my last role, I led the development of the university's 10 year strategic plan, as well as the creation/operations of the organization's first internal strategy function.
